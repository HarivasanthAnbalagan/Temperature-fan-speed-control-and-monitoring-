This project presents the design and implementation of a temperature-based fan speed control and monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller, a 16x2 LCD display, an LM35 temperature sensor, and a voltage regulator. The primary objective is to automatically control the fan speed based on temperature readings from the LM35 sensor. As the temperature changes, the system adjusts the fan's speed proportionally, providing an efficient and energy-saving approach to temperature control. The system also displays real-time temperature and fan speed status on the LCD, making it ideal for applications in industrial and domestic environments where controlled cooling is necessary
